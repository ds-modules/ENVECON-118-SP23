This folder contains Jupyter Notebooks for all our problem sets. We highly advise that you initially make a separate copy of the provided .ipynb file to preserve an original blank version. After copying, rename the file by appending "_FirstName_LastName" to it, and then proceed to work on this renamed copy.
